# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains various implementations and examples of common data structures and algorithms in Python.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. It is intended for educational purposes and to help developers understand and implement these concepts in their own projects.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd DSA
```

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own Python file within the `src` directory. You can run the examples and tests provided to see how each implementation works.

Example:

```bash
python src/linked_list.py
```
